## The main vision, idea, area (etc.)

Our goal is to create a machine learning algorithm which can extract the type/genre of the music it is being fed. Further, we would like to aim at generating music from these trending/related sounds.



## A deeper rationale of the project

A large problem in Twitch/YouTube communities, is the DMCA rules on copy-written music. A typical solution is to use common, duty free music. The largest problem here, is that the same song typically circulates among creators. This prevents new upstarts from gaining a unique foothold. Especially since larger creators can afford to make or buy rights to their own unique music. The goal of our project would ultimately be to generate ambient music for background audio in Twitch/YouTube videos. This would provide creators with consistently unique, duty free options. To do this, we would employ machine learning algorithms to playback a sequence of sounds. Our first step in meeting this goal, is to extract information on the songs within our collection - like genre. This will ensure our system creates pop songs from pop songs, dubstep from dubstep, etc, etc.









## Description of the business need or opportunity (innovation) that we envision


As stated in our golden circle, this would fill a need for immediate & unique music at the click of a button. Since the music serves as background ambiance than being in the forefront, it can afford to be artificial. This is unlike auto generated stories/scripts, which often read very silly and make no logical sense. The benefit here, is that most twitch streams run free/paid extensions to stream a playlist of music. Its almost always the same music.  This will help new creators generate a unique presence, without needing to spend money on unique music. 

Further, auto generated music could serve as an inspirational tool, becoming the backbone for artist's own creations. A sound artist might use what we generate, and edit it into a consistent beat which they then write chords for.







## Msc.
We have spoken with professor Yow in a private meeting, and given that our project is on machine learning, would very much like to have him as our mentor. He is easily our number 1 choice. It seems like a sensible arrangement.
